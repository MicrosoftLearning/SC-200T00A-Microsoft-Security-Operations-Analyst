```KQL
let suspiciousAccounts = datatable(account: string) [
    @"\administrator", 
    @"NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
];
SecurityEvent | where TimeGenerated > ago(1h) and Account in (suspiciousAccounts)
```

3. The following statement demonstrates the use of the "let" statement to declare a dynamic table. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
let LowActivityAccounts =
    SecurityEvent 
    | summarize cnt = count() by Account 
    | where cnt < 10;
LowActivityAccounts | where Account contains "sql"
```

4. The following statement demonstrates searching across all tables and columns for records within the query time range display in the query window. In the Query Window before running this script change the **Time range** to "Last hour". Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
search "err"
```

>**Warning:** Make sure you change back the Time range to "Last 24 hours" for the next scripts.

5. The following statement demonstrates searching across tables listed with the "in" clause for records within the query time range display in the query window. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
search in (SecurityEvent,SecurityAlert,A*) "err"
```

6. The following statements demonstrates filter using the where operator. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

    >**Note:** You should "run" after entering the query from each code block below.

```KQL
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
```

```KQL
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h) and EventID == "4624"
```

```KQL
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where EventID == 4624
| where AccountType =~ "user"
```

```KQL

    AlertSeverity == "High", 3,
    AlertSeverity == "Medium", 2, 
    AlertSeverity == "Low", 1,
    AlertSeverity == "Informational", 0,
    -1)
```

8. The following statement demonstrates sorting results using the order by operator. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated > ago(90d)
| extend severityOrder = case (
    AlertSeverity == "High", 3,
    AlertSeverity == "Medium", 2, 
    AlertSeverity == "Low", 1,
    AlertSeverity == "Informational", 0,
    -1)
| order by severityOrder desc
```

9. The following statements demonstrate specifying fields for the result set using the project operators.

    >**Note:** You should "Run" after entering the query from each code block below.

In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| project Computer, Account
```

```KQL
SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated > ago(90d)
| extend severityOrder = case (
    AlertSeverity == "High", 3,
    AlertSeverity == "Medium", 2, 
    AlertSeverity == "Low", 1,
    AlertSeverity == "Informational", 0,
    -1)
| order by severityOrder
| project-away severityOrder
```


### Task 3: Analyze Results in KQL with the Summarize Operator

In this task, you will build KQL statements to prepare data.

1. The following statement demonstrates the count function. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h) and where EventID == "4688"
| summarize count() by Process, Computer
```

2. The following statement demonstrates the count function. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h) and EventID == 4624
| summarize cnt=count() by AccountType, Computer
```

3. The following statement demonstrates the dcount function. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| summarize dcount(IpAddress)
```

4. The following statement demonstrates the arg_max function.

The following statement will return the most current row from the SecurityEvent table for the computer SQL12.NA.contosohotels.com.  The * in the arg_max function requests all columns for the row. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
SecurityEvent 
| where Computer == "SQL12.na.contosohotels.com"
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated,*) by Computer
```

5. The following statement demonstrates the arg_min function.

In this statement, the oldest SecurityEvent for the computer SQL12.NA.contosohotels.com will be returned as the result set. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
SecurityEvent 
| where Computer == "SQL12.na.contosohotels.com"
| summarize arg_min(TimeGenerated,*) by Computer
```

6. The following statements demonstrate the importance of understanding results based on the order of the pipe "|". In the Query Window. Enter the following queries and run each separately: 

**Query 1** will have Accounts for which the last activity was a login. The SecurityEvent table will first be summarized and return the most current row for each Account.  Then only rows with EventID equals 4624 (login) will be returned.

```KQL
SecurityEvent
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by Account
| where EventID == "4624"
```

**Query 2** will have the most recent login for Accounts that have logged in.  The SecurityEvent table will be filtered to only include EventID = 4624. Then these results will be summarized for the most current login row by Account.

```KQL
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == "4624"
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by Account
```

>**Note:**  You can also review the "Total CPU" and "Data used for processed query" by selecting the bar "Completed" and compare the data between both statements.

7. The following statement demonstrates the make_list function.

The make_list function returns a dynamic (JSON) array of all the values of Expression in the group. This KQL query will first filter the EventID with the where operator.  Next, for each Computer, the results are a JSON array of Accounts. The resulting JSON array will include duplicate accounts.

In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where EventID == "4624"
| summarize make_list(Account) by Computer
```

8. The following statement demonstrates the make_set function.

The make_set function returns a dynamic (JSON) array containing *distinct* values that Expression takes in the group. This KQL query will first filter the EventID with the where operator.  Next, for each Computer, the results are a JSON array of unique Accounts. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where EventID == "4624"
| summarize make_set(Account) by Computer
```

### Task 4: Create visualizations in KQL with the Render Operator

In this task, you will use generate visualizations with KQL statements.

1. The following statement demonstrates the render function visualizing results with a barchart. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
SecurityEvent 
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| summarize count() by Account
| render barchart
```

2. The following statement demonstrates the render function visualizing results with a time series.

The bin() function rounds values down to an integer multiple of the given bin size.  Used frequently in combination with summarize by .... If you have a scattered set of values, the values are grouped into a smaller set of specific values.  Combining the generated time series and pipe to a render operator with a type of timechart provides a time series visualization. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
SecurityEvent 
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1m) 
| render timechart
```


### Task 5: Build multi-table statements in KQL

In this task, you will build multi-table KQL statements.

1. The following statement demonstrates the union operator that takes two or more tables and returns the rows of all of them. Understanding how results are passed and impacted with the pipe character is essential. In the Query Window. Enter the following statements and select **Run** for each separately to see the results: 

**Query 1** will return all rows of SecurityEvent and all rows of SecurityAlert.

```KQL
SecurityBaseline  
| union SecurityEvent 
```

**Query 2** will return one row and column, which is the count of all rows of SecurityEvent and all rows of SecurityAlert.

```KQL
SecurityBaseline  
| union SecurityEvent  
| summarize count() 
```

**Query 3** will return all rows of SecurityEvent and one row for SecurityAlert.  The row for SecurityAlert will have the count of the SecurityAlert rows.

```KQL
SecurityBaseline 
| union (SecurityEvent  | summarize count() | project count_) 
```

2. The following statement demonstrates the union operator support for wildcards to union multiple tables. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
union Security* 
| summarize count() by Type
```

3. The following statement demonstrates the join operator, which merges the rows of two tables to form a new table by matching the specified columns' values from each table. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
SecurityEvent 
| where EventID == "4624" 
| summarize LogOnCount=count() by EventID, Account 
| project LogOnCount, Account 
| join kind = inner (
SecurityEvent 
| where EventID == "4634" 
| summarize LogOffCount=count() by EventID, Account 
| project LogOffCount, Account 
) on Account
```

The first table specified in the join is considered the Left table.  The table after the join keyword is the right table.  When working with columns from the tables, the $left.Column name and $right.Column name is to distinguish which tables column are referenced. 


### Task 6: Work with string data in KQL

In this task, you will work with structured and unstructured string fields with KQL statements.

1. The following statement demonstrates the extract function.  Extract gets a match for a regular expression from a text string. You have the option to convert the extracted substring to the indicated type. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
print extract("x=([0-9.]+)", 1, "hello x=45.6|wo") == "45.6"
```

2. The following statements use the extract function to pull out the Account Name from the Account field of the SecurityEvent table. In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and select **Run**: 

```KQL
let top3 = SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where AccountType == 'User'
| extend Account_Name = extract(@"^(.*\\)?([^@]*)(@.*)?$", 2, tolower(Account))
| summarize Attempts = count() by Account_Name
| where Account_Name != ""
| top 3 by Attempts 
| summarize make_list(Account_Name);
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where AccountType == 'User'
| extend Name = extract(@"^(.*\\)?([^@]*)(@.*)?$", 2, tolower(Account))
| extend Account_Name = iff(Name in (top3), Name, "Other")
| where Account_Name != ""
| summarize Attempts = count() by Account_Name
| sort by Attempts
```

3. The following statement demonstrates the parse function. Parse evaluates a string expression and parses its value into one or more calculated columns. The computed columns will have nulls for unsuccessfully parsed strings.

```KQL
let Traces = datatable(EventText:string)
[
"Event: NotifySliceRelease (resourceName=PipelineScheduler, totalSlices=27, sliceNumber=23, lockTime=02/17/2016 08:40:01, releaseTime=02/17/2016 08:40:01, previousLockTime=02/17/2016 08:39:01)",
"Event: NotifySliceRelease (resourceName=PipelineScheduler, totalSlices=27, sliceNumber=15, lockTime=02/17/2016 08:40:00, releaseTime=02/17/2016 08:40:00, previousLockTime=02/17/2016 08:39:00)",
"Event: NotifySliceRelease (resourceName=PipelineScheduler, totalSlices=27, sliceNumber=20, lockTime=02/17/2016 08:40:01, releaseTime=02/17/2016 08:40:01, previousLockTime=02/17/2016 08:39:01)",
"Event: NotifySliceRelease (resourceName=PipelineScheduler, totalSlices=27, sliceNumber=22, lockTime=02/17/2016 08:41:01, releaseTime=02/17/2016 08:41:00, previousLockTime=02/17/2016 08:40:01)",
"Event: NotifySliceRelease (resourceName=PipelineScheduler, totalSlices=27, sliceNumber=16, lockTime=02/17/2016 08:41:00, releaseTime=02/17/2016 08:41:00, previousLockTime=02/17/2016 08:40:00)"
];
Traces  
| parse EventText with * "resourceName=" resourceName ", totalSlices=" totalSlices:long * "sliceNumber=" sliceNumber:long * "lockTime=" lockTime ", releaseTime=" releaseTime:date "," * "previousLockTime=" previousLockTime:date ")" *  
| project resourceName, totalSlices, sliceNumber, lockTime, releaseTime, previousLockTime
```

4. The following statement demonstrates working with dynamics fields, which are special since they can take on any value of other data types. In this example, the Properties field from the AppAvailabilityResults table is of type dynamic.
In the Query Window enter the following statement and select Run:

```KQL
AppAvailabilityResults | project Properties
```

5. To access the strings within a Dynamic field, use the dot notation. The Properties field from the AppAvailabilityResults table is of type dynamic. In this example, you could access the SyntheticMonitorId with the Properties.SyntheticMonitorId field name.

In the Query Window. Enter the following statement and **Run**:
```KQL
AppAvailabilityResults | project Name=Properties.WebtestArmResourceName, Location=Properties.WebtestLocationId, Id=Properties.SyntheticMonitorId
```

6. The following statement demonstrates functions to manipulate JSON stored in string fields. Many logs submit data in JSON format, which requires you to know how to transform JSON data to queryable fields. 

In the Query Window. Enter the following statements individually and select **Run**: 

```KQL
 ContainerInventory  
 | where TimeGenerated > ago(1h) 
 | extend Command = todynamic(Command) 
 | extend Cmd = Command.[0]
 | extend Param1 = Command.[1]
 | extend Param2 = Command.[2]
 | project-away Command 
 | order by tostring(Cmd)
```
The mv-expand operator expands multi-value dynamic arrays or property bags into multiple records.

```KQL
 ContainerInventory  
 | where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
 | mv-expand Command = todynamic(Command) 
 | project ContainerHostname,Command
```
The mv-apply operator applies a subquery to each record and returns the union of the results of all subqueries.

```KQL
SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(90d)
| mv-apply entity = todynamic(Entities) on 
( where entity.Type == "account" | extend account = strcat (entity.NTDomain, "\\", entity.Name))
```

6. To create a function:

    >**Note:** You will not be able to do this in the lademo environment used for data in this lab, but it's an important concept to be used in your environment. 

After running a query, select the **Save** button and then select **Save As function** from the drop-down. Enter the name your want, for example: *MailboxForward* in the **Function name** box and enter a **Legacy category**, like *General* and select **Save**.

The function will be available in KQL by using the function alias:

```KQL
MailboxForward
```

## You have completed the lab.
