# Learning Path 3 - Lab 1 - Exercise 2 - Mitigate threats using Microsoft Defender for Cloud

## Lab scenario

![Lab overview.](../Media/SC-200-Lab_Diagrams_Mod3_L1_Ex2.png)

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Defender for Cloud. You need to respond to recommendations and security alerts generated by Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

>**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/SC-200%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Mitigate%20threats%20using%20Microsoft%20Defender%20for%20Cloud)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same.

    >**Note:** You might want to return later to *Regulatory compliance* to review the new standard controls and recommendations.

### Task 2: Explore Security posture and recommendations

In this task, you will review cloud security posture management.  The Secure Score information can take 24 hours to recalculate. It is recommended to do this task again in 24 hours.

### Task 3: Mitigate security alerts

In this task, you will load sample security alerts and review the alert details.


1. Under *General*, select **Security alerts** in the portal menu.

1. Select **Sample alerts** from the command bar. **Hint:** you may need to select the ellipsis (...) button from the command bar.

1. In the Create sample alerts (Preview) pane make sure your subscription is selected and that all sample alerts are selected in the *Defender for Cloud plans* area.
