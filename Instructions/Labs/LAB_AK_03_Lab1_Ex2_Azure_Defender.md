# Learning Path 3 - Lab 1 - Exercise 2 - Mitigate threats using Microsoft Defender for Cloud

## Lab scenario

![Lab overview.](../Media/SC-200-Lab_Diagrams_Mod3_L1_Ex2.png)

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Defender for Cloud. You need to respond to recommendations and security alerts generated by Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
