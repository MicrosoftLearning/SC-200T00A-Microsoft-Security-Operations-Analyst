# Learning Path 8 - Lab 1 - Exercise 2 - Connect Windows devices to Microsoft Sentinel using data connectors

## Lab scenario

![Lab overview.](../Media/SC-200-Lab_Diagrams_Mod6_L1_Ex2.png)

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You must learn how to connect log data from the many data sources in your organization. The next source of data is Windows virtual machines inside and outside of Azure, like On-Premises environments or other Public Clouds.

>**Important:** The lab exercises for Learning Path #8 are in a *standalone* environment. If you exit the lab before completing it, you will be required to re-run the configurations again.

### Estimated time to complete this lab: 30 minutes

### Task 1: Create a Windows Virtual Machine in Azure

In this task, you'll create a Windows virtual machine in Azure.

1. Select **Dev/Test** and then select **Continue to create a VM**.

1. Select **Create new** for *Resource group*, enter RG-AZWIN01 as Name and select **OK**.

    >**Note:** This will be a new resource group for tracking purposes. 

1. In *Virtual machine name*, enter AZWIN01.

1. Leave **(US) East US** as the default value for *Region*.

1. Scroll down and review the *Image* for the virtual machine. If it appears empty, select **Windows 10 Enterprise, version 22H2**.

1. Review the *Size* for the virtual machine. If it appears empty, select **See all sizes**, choose the first VM size under *Most used by Azure users* and select **Select**.

    >**Note:** If you see the message: *This image is not supported for Azure Automanage. To disable this feature,navigate to the Management tab. Otherwise, select a supported image.* Go to the Management tab and disable "Automanage". The creation process will succeed afterwards.

1. Scroll down and enter a *Username* of your choosing. **Hint:** Avoid reserved words like admin or root.

1. Enter a *Password* of your choosing. **Hint:** It might be easier to re-use your tenant password. It can be found in the resources tab.

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select the checkbox below *Licensing* to confirm you have the eligible license.

1. Select **Review + create** and wait until the validation is passed.

    >**Note:** If there is a *Networking* validation failure, select that tab, review its contents and then select **Review + create** again.

1. Select **Create**. Wait for the Resource to be created, this may take a few minutes.

### Task 2: Install Azure Arc on an On-Premises Server

In this task, you install Azure Arc on an on-premises server to make onboarding easier.

>**Important:** The next steps are done in a different machine than the one you were previously working. Look for the Virtual Machine name references.

1. Log in to **WINServer** virtual machine as Administrator with the password: **Passw0rd!** if necessary.  

1. Open the Microsoft Edge browser and navigate to the Azure portal at <https://portal.azure.com>.

1. In the **Sign in** dialog box, copy, and paste in the **Tenant Email** account provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Next**.

1. In the **Enter password** dialog box, copy, and paste in the **Tenant Password** provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Sign in**.

1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type *Arc*, then select **Azure Arc**.

1. In the navigation pane under **Azure Arc resources** select **Machines**

1. Select **+ Add/Create**, then select **Add a machine**.

1. Select **Generate script** from the "Add a single server" section.

1. In the *Add a server with Azure Arc* page, select the Resource group you created earlier under *Project details*. **Hint:** *RG-Defender*

    >**Note:** If you haven't already created a resource group, open another tab and create the resource group and start over.

1. For *Region*, select **(US) East Us** from the drop-down list.

1. Review the *Server details* and *Connectivity method* options. Keep the default values and select **Next** to get to the Tags tab.

1. Review the default available tags. Select **Next** to get to the Download and run script tab.

1. Scroll down and select the **Download** button. **Hint:** if your browser blocks the download, take action in the browser to allow it. In Microsoft Edge Browser, select the ellipsis button (...) if needed and then select **Keep**.

1. Right-click the Windows Start button and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.

1. Enter *Administrator* for "Username" and *Passw0rd!* for "Password" if you get a UAC prompt.

1. Enter: cd C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads

    >**Important:** If you do not have this directory, most likely means that you are in the wrong machine. Go back to the beginning of Task 4 and change to WINServer and start over.

1. Type *Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted* and press enter.

1. Enter **A** for Yes to All and press enter.

1. Type *.\OnboardingScript.ps1* and press enter.  

    >**Important:** If you get the error *"The term .\OnboardingScript.ps1 is not recognized..."*, make sure you are doing the steps for Task 4 in the WINServer virtual machine. Other issue might be that the name of the file changed due to multiple downloads, search for *".\OnboardingScript (1).ps1"* or other file numbers in the running directory.

1. Enter **R** to Run once and press enter (this may take a couple minutes).

1. The setup process opens a new Microsoft Edge browser tab to authenticate the Azure Arc agent. Select your admin account, wait for the message "Authentication complete" and then go back to the Windows PowerShell window.
