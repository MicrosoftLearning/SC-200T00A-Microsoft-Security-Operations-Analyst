# Learning Path 7 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Configure your Microsoft Sentinel environment

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that is implementing Microsoft Sentinel. You are responsible for setting up the Microsoft Sentinel environment to meet the company requirement to minimize cost, meet compliance regulations, and provide the most manageable environment for your security team to perform their daily job responsibilities.

>**Important:** The lab exercises for Learning Path #7 are in a *standalone* environment. If you exit the lab before completing it, you will be required to re-run the configurations again.

### Estimated time to complete this lab: 30 minutes

### Task 1 - Create a Log Analytics workspace

Create a Log Analytics workspace, including region option. Learn more about [onboarding Microsoft Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/quickstart-onboard).

1. Change data retention period to **180 days**.

1. Select **OK**.

### Task 4: Create a Watchlist

In this task, you will create a watchlist in Microsoft Sentinel.

1. Type *Hostname* then enter for a new line.

1. From row 2 of the notepad, copy the following hostnames, each one in a different line:

    Host2
    Host3
    Host4
    Host5
    ```

1. Select **+ New** from the command bar.

1. In the Watchlist wizard, enter the following:

    |General setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Name|**HighValueHosts**|
    |Description|**High Value Hosts**|
    |Watchlist alias|**HighValueHosts**|

    >**Important:** It could take up to ten minutes for the watchlist to appear. **Please continue to with the following task and run this command on the next lab**.

    >**Note:** You can now use the _GetWatchlist('HighValueHosts') in your own KQL statements to access the list. The column to reference would be *Hostname*.

1. Close the *Logs* window by selecting the 'x' in the top-right and select **OK** to discard the unsaved edits.

### Task 5: Create a Threat Indicator

1. Run the following KQL statement.

    ```KQL
    ThreatIntelligenceIndicator
    ```

    ThreatIntelligenceIndicator 
    | project DomainName
    ```

### Task 6: Configure log retention

In this task, you will change the retention period for the SecurityEvent table.
