# Learning Path 7 - Lab 1 - Exercise 7 - Create Detections

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You are going to work with Log Analytics KQL queries and from there, you will create custom analytics rules to help discover threats and anomalous behaviors in your environment.

Analytics rules search for specific events or sets of events across your environment, alert you when certain event thresholds or conditions are reached, generate incidents for your SOC to triage and investigate, and respond to threats with automated tracking and reMediation processes.


>**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/SC-200%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Create%20detections)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 


### Task 1: Persistence Attack Detection

>**Important:** The next steps are done in a different machine than the one you were previously working. Look for the Virtual Machine name references.

In this task, you will create a detection for the first attack of the previous exercise.

1. Log in to WIN1 virtual machine as Admin with the password: **Pa55w.rd**.  

1. In the Edge browser, navigate to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.

1. In the **Sign in** dialog box, copy and paste in the **Tenant Email** account provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Next**.

1. In the **Enter password** dialog box, copy and paste in the **Tenant Password** provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Sign in**.

1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type *Sentinel*, then select **Microsoft Sentinel**.

1. Select your Microsoft Sentinel Workspace you created earlier.

1. Select **Logs** from the *General* section.

1. **Run** the following KQL Statement again to recall the tables where we have this data:

    ```KQL
    search "temp\\startup.bat"
    ```

    >**Note:** A result with the event might take up to 5 minutes to appear. Wait until it does. If it does not appear, make sure you have rebooted WINServer as instructed in the previous exercise and that you have completed the Task #3 of the Learning Path 6 Lab, Exercise 2.

1. The table *SecurityEvent* looks to have the data already normalized and easy for us to query. Expand the row to see all the columns related to the record.

1. From the results, we now know that the Threat Actor is using reg.exe to add keys to the Registry key and the program is located in C:\temp. **Run** the following statement to replace the *search* operator with the *where* operator in our query:

    ```KQL
    SecurityEvent 
    | where Activity startswith "4688" 
    | where Process == "reg.exe" 
    | where CommandLine startswith "REG" 
    ```

1. It is important to help the Security Operations Center Analyst by providing as much context about the alert as you can. This includes projecting Entities for use in the investigation graph. **Run** the following query:

    ```KQL
    SecurityEvent 
    | where Activity startswith "4688" 
    | where Process == "reg.exe" 
    | where CommandLine startswith "REG" 
    | extend timestamp = TimeGenerated, HostCustomEntity = Computer, AccountCustomEntity = SubjectUserName
    ```

1. Now that you have a good detection rule, in the Logs window, select the **+ New alert rule** in the command bar and then select **Create Microsoft Sentinel alert**. This will create a new Scheduled rule. **Hint:** You might need to select the ellipsis (...) button in the command bar.

1. This starts the "Analytics rule wizard". For the *General* tab type:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Name|**Startup RegKey**|
    |Description|**Startup Regkey in c:\temp**|
    |Tactics|**Persistence**|
    |Severity|**High**|

1. Select **Next: Set rule logic >** button.

1. On the *Set rule logic* tab, the *Rule query* should be populated already with you KQL query, as well as the entities under *Alert enrichment - Entity mapping*.

    |Entity|Identifier|Data Field|
    |:----|:----|:----|
    |Account|FullName|AccountCustomEntity|
    |Host|Hostname|HostCustomEntity|

1. If **Hostname** isn't selected for *Host* Entity, select it from the drop-down list.

1. For *Query scheduling* set the following:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Run Query every|5 minutes|
    |Lookup data from the last|1 Days|

    >**Note:** We are purposely generating many incidents for the same data. This enables the Lab to use these alerts.

1. Leave the rest of the options with the defaults. Select **Next: Incident settings>** button.

1. For the *Incident settings* tab, leave the default values and select **Next: Automated response >** button.

1. On the *Automated response* tab under *Automation rules*, select **Add new**.

1. For the *Automation rule name*, enter **Startup RegKey**.

1. The *Trigger* should default to **When incident is created**.

1. For the *Actions*, select **Assign owner**.

1. Then select **Assign to me**. Then select **+ Add action**.

1. Use the *And then* drop-down menus to select **Run playbook**

    >**Note:** You have already assigned permissions to the playbook, so it will be available.

1. From the drop-down menu, select the playbook **PostMessageTeams-OnAlert** you created in the previous exercise.

1. Select **Apply**

1. Select the **Next: Review >** button.
  
1. On the *Review and created* tab, select the **Create** button to create the new Scheduled Analytics rule.


### Task 2: Privilege Elevation Attack Detection

In this task, you will create a detection for the second attack of the previous exercise.

1. In the Microsoft Sentinel portal, select **Logs** from the General section in case you navigated away from this page.

1. **Run** the following KQL Statement to identify any entry that refers to administrators:

    ```KQL
    search "administrators" 
    | summarize count() by $table
    ```

1. The result might show events from different tables, but in our case, we want to investigate the SecurityEvent table. The EventID and Event that we are looking is "4732 - A member was added to a security-enabled local group". With this, we will identify adding a member to a privileged group. **Run** the following KQL query to confirm:

    ```KQL
    SecurityEvent 
    | where EventID == 4732
    | where TargetAccount == "Builtin\\Administrators"
    ```

1. Expand the row to see all the columns related to the record. The username of the account added as Administrator does not show. The issue is that instead of storing the username, we have the Security IDentifier (SID). **Run** the following KQL to match the SID to the username that was added to the Administrators group:

    ```KQL
    SecurityEvent 
    | where EventID == 4732
    | where TargetAccount == "Builtin\\Administrators"
    | extend Acct = MemberSid, MachId = SourceComputerId  
    | join kind=leftouter (
        SecurityEvent 
        | summarize count() by TargetSid, SourceComputerId, TargetUserName 
        | project Acct1 = TargetSid, MachId1 = SourceComputerId, UserName1 = TargetUserName) on $left.MachId == $right.MachId1, $left.Acct == $right.Acct1
    ```

   ![Screenshot](../Media/SC200_sysmon_attack3.png)

1. Extend the row to show the resulting columns, in the last one, we see the name of the added user under the *UserName1* column we *project* within the KQL query. It is important to help the Security Operations Analyst by providing as much context about the alert as you can. This includes projecting Entities for use in the investigation graph. **Run** the following query:

    ```KQL
    SecurityEvent 
    | where EventID == 4732
    | where TargetAccount == "Builtin\\Administrators"
    | extend Acct = MemberSid, MachId = SourceComputerId  
    | join kind=leftouter (
        SecurityEvent 
        | summarize count() by TargetSid, SourceComputerId, TargetUserName 
        | project Acct1 = TargetSid, MachId1 = SourceComputerId, UserName1 = TargetUserName) on $left.MachId == $right.MachId1, $left.Acct == $right.Acct1
    | extend timestamp = TimeGenerated, HostCustomEntity = Computer, AccountCustomEntity = UserName1
    ```

1. Now that you have a good detection rule, in the Logs window, select **+ New alert rule** in the command bar and then select **Create Microsoft Sentinel alert**. **Hint:** You might need to select the ellipsis (...) button in the command bar.

1. This starts the "Analytics rule wizard". For the *General* tab type:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Name|**SecurityEvent Local Administrators User Add**|
    |Description|**User added to Local Administrators group**|
    |Tactics|**Privilege Escalation**|
    |Severity|**High**|

1. Select **Next: Set rule logic >** button. 

1. On the *Set rule logic* tab, the *Rule query* should be populated already with you KQL query, as well the entities under *Alert enrichment - Entitiy mapping*.

1. For *Query scheduling* set the following:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Run Query every|5 minutes|
    |Look data from the last|1 Days|

    >**Note:** We are purposely generating many incidents for the same data. This enables the Lab to use these alerts.

1. Leave the rest of the options with the defaults. Select **Next: Incident settings>** button.

1. For the *Incident settings* tab, leave the default values and select **Next: Automated response >** button.

1. On the *Automated response* tab under *Automation rules*, select **Add new**.

1. For the *Automation rule name*, enter **SecurityEvent Local Administrators User Add**.

1. The *Trigger* should default to **When incident is created**.

1. For the *Actions*, select **Assign owner**.

1. Then select **Assign to me**. Then select **+ Add action**.

1. Use the *And then* drop-down menus to select **Run playbook**

    >**Note:** You have already assigned permissions to the playbook, so it will be available.

1. From the drop-down menu, select the playbook **PostMessageTeams-OnAlert** you created in the previous exercise.

1. Select **Apply**

1. Select the **Next: Review >** button.
  
1. On the *Review and created* tab, select the **Create** button to create the new Scheduled Analytics rule.

1. For the *Automated response* tab select the **PostMessageTeams-OnAlert** under *Alert automation (classic)* and then select **Next: Review** button.

1. On the *Review* tab, select the **Create** button to create the new Scheduled Analytics rule.
